## Introduction
Bill Saver is an app built with React and powered by Hedera's blazing fast API which allows a user to see previously-stored bills. 

The app stores it in the blockchain, so it can't be tampered with at any time, and so the bank statements and other private information cannot be back or leaked.

This project was made for HackUNT Hackathon
